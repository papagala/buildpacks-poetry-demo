# Automated Docker Images

This repository is meant to be used as examples for how to turn ML code from common libraries like SKLearn into an Inference Endpoint that can be deployed into Kubeflow. Each one of these folders under `frameworks` is a stand-alone example that should help you determine how to turn your code into an endpoint seamlessly.
